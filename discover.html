                <p style="margin-top: 2rem; text-align: left; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">I chose to come to Duluth and UMD because when I visited here for my audition for the BFA program I felt like I was being welcomed into a new family and that made me feel excited to attend this school which is something I hadn't found at any of the other schools I had toured. I also have come to Duluth several other times with family, either passing through to go further up the north shore or to spend a few days in the city. I have always admired the beauty of the city and being this close to Lake Superior felt like it would be a dream come true and it has. I am so happy I made the choice to come to Duluth because I have met so many friends that I will hold close for the rest of my life, like it felt when I first toured here. I was welcomed into the family that is the theater department. I also have been able to see some of the most beautiful views in my time living here.</p>
