                        <p>I am Emerson Spencer I grew up in Saint Paul Minnesota I am an actor currently doing my undergrad in a BFA Acting program at The University of Minnesota Duluth. I grew up taking camera acting classes with Film North, a company training young actors. Since coming to UMD I have been in about 8 shows of varying types, several musicals and plays. I also take voice lessons and am currently taking a stage combat class. I have discovered a blossoming community and group of friends here at UMD. I also grew up playing soccer and many other sports but soccer remains my favorite sport to this day and take any oppertunity I can to play it.

                        <p>I have been playing the guitar for about 5 years now. Since playing the guitar, it has become one of my biggest passions in life, it has helped me through hard times, and it has even landed me some cool opportunities and friends! I also have even started writing my own music with a friend, it has become a super fun bonding experience and has brought me so much closer to my friends</p>

                        <p>Duluth is one of the best cities for nature and hiking, being on the shore of Lake Superior. Since moving here, I have discovered a love for being out in nature, weather it be swimming at park point, finding a new hidden hiking spot, skipping rocks or just kind of walking off trail into the forest. Being in nature has really become a great way that I decompress from all the stress of being a college student.</p>
