                    <p>I started playing the guitar in 2020 about in the middle of the pandemic and shortly after began taking lessons with Kelly Weeks with at the Twin Cities School of Music. I have learned how to play both electric guitars and acoustic guitars quite proficiently. Playing the guitar led me to be able to be able to play as one of the ensemble members in the musical Great Comet which was one of my favorite experiences as a performer.</p>

                    <p>I also love nature and being out in it this is part of the reason I love going to school here in Duluth. There is such easy access to some of the most gorgeous land and hiking trails here in Minnesota and frankly the whole country. Having such easy access to Lake Superior is so nice quite often me and a friend will take out guitars down to the water and relax and decompress with the gorgeous land scape around us.</p>
