                    <p>I started playing the guitar in 2020 about in the middle of the pandemic and shortly after began taking lessons with Kelly Weeks with at the Twin Cities School of Music. I have learned how to play both electric guitars and acoustic guitars quite proficiently. Playing the guitar led me to be able to perform as one of the ensemble members in the musical Natasha Pierre and The Great Comet of 1812 which was one of my favorite experiences as a performer. In the last year one of my closest friends and I began writing music with each other, me who is proficient at the guitar and Aaron (my friend, pictured on the right) who is proficient at piano and lyricism. This has sparked a whole new side of creativity for me that has been so exciting to explore. A few years ago, I took a musical theater music theory class and consistently used things I learned in that class when writing music. We haven't released any music but hope to one day. Through writing together our bond as friends has swelled. I have been able to slowly teach him guitar and now we can play together as seen in the photo on the right. Guitar has become such an important part of my life from helping me express my emotions in hard times, to building and strengthening relationships between friends and family.</p>

                    <p>I also love nature and being out in it this is part of the reason I love going to school here in Duluth. There is such easy access to some of the most gorgeous land and hiking trails here in Minnesota and frankly the whole country. Having such easy access to Lake Superior is so nice. Quite often my friends and I will take our guitars down to the water and relax and decompress with the gorgeous landscape around us. One important memory I hold with me when it comes to nature and hiking is in my freshman year of college my mentor who was a junior at the time took me to this hiking trail just outside of Duluth called Ely's Peak (pictured in the banner at the top of this page). It was my first time going there and we were completely alone because it was like mid-February and it is a relatively rough hike. But I remember so many laughs and then when we reached the top the view was so gorgeous we just sat there and talked about life and all the things that come along with it. There is just something about nature and being in a place like that makes me feel comfortable and safe. So, over the last few years when I am having a hard time I will go back to Ely's peak and just allow myself to breathe. I have also brought my friends and family up there to share my love of that place. I have so many Important moments in my life that I can connect to being out in nature a few consist of Ely's Peak (of course), a trip to the boundary waters with a group of friends in 2021, a trip to the apostle islands with friends as well in 2022, and so many more for me so much in my life comes back to frolicking in nature.</p>
